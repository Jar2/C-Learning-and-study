# C-Learning-and-study
This is going to be my repository where i can learn C++ and if theres any problems you can write your comments in the code to help me out and thanks!


Also to compile the program you need to write this into the command line;

g++ -o textgame -I headers/ smallgame.cpp
this will make the game compile.. hopefully
